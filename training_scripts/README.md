# Training Examples

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate how to use the machine learning modules for physics-based surrogate reservoir modeling, with a focus on handling dry gas (DG) and gas condensate (GC) fluid type scenarios both above and below dew point.

The examples demonstrate:
1. Model training for Dry Gas (DG) fluid type
2. Model training for Gas Condensate (GC) fluid type above dew point (using hard enforcement only).
3. Model training for Gas Condensate (GC) fluid type below dew point (using deep learning layers and hard enforcement layers).

These examples are to help researchers and engineers to set-up and train the surrogate models appropriately in different cases.
